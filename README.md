The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px 
- Desktop: 1440px

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Positions
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned
The main difficulty I ran into was how to show the background images according to the design. 
I have not used background-position before so, it was my first time trying it. ðŸš€
